# Intelligent Agent Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Terminal Logs

Based on the terminal logs provided, I identified several critical issues with the intelligent agent's expense tracking logic:

### 1. **Poor Amount Parsing**
**Problem**: The agent failed to parse amounts with "k" and "m" suffixes correctly.
- `"2k"` should parse to `2000` but was failing
- `"25k"` should parse to `25000` but was failing
- `"9k"` should parse to `9000` but was failing

**Evidence from logs**:
```
User: "fuel 500, hat 2k, watch 25k"
Agent: "Sorry about that! It looks like we're missing some information to log your expense."
```

### 2. **Inconsistent Context Handling**
**Problem**: The agent was not properly using pending expense context from previous messages.
- When user provided incomplete information, the agent would ask for missing details
- But when user provided the missing information in follow-up messages, the agent would ignore the context

**Evidence from logs**:
```
User: "popcorn 500"
Agent: "Hey! I've got the amount '500' from your message, but I need a little more info..."

User: "i bought fucking popcorn"
Agent: "Hey there! I'm happy to help you log your expense! However, I noticed that I'm still missing some details..."
```

### 3. **LLM Router Issues**
**Problem**: The router was not correctly extracting data from messages with multiple expenses.
- Messages like "fuel 500, hat 2k, watch 25k" should extract the first expense (fuel 500)
- Instead, the router was failing to parse any expense data

### 4. **Category Mapping Problems**
**Problem**: Items were being categorized incorrectly or as "misc".
- "popcorn" was being categorized as "misc" instead of "food"
- "baseball bat" was being categorized as "misc" instead of "sports"
- "hat" was being categorized as "misc" instead of "clothing"
- "cricket kit" was being categorized as "misc" instead of "sports"
- "gaming mouse" was being categorized as "misc" instead of "electronics"

### 5. **Response Inconsistency**
**Problem**: The agent gave different responses for the same incomplete information.
- Sometimes asking for more details
- Sometimes logging the expense anyway
- Sometimes giving confusing responses

### 6. **Context Not Clearing After Expense Logging**
**Problem**: After successfully logging an expense, the agent remained stuck in expense logging context.
- User said "g" after logging cricket kit â†’ got same success message
- User said "thanks" after logging gaming mouse â†’ got same success message
- User said "again?" â†’ got confusing car purchase response
- User said "also" after logging chocolate â†’ got same success message
- User said "no not again" â†’ got clarification instead of understanding frustration

### 7. **Poor Expense Recognition**
**Problem**: The agent was not recognizing clear expense statements in natural language.
- "bought sweets" â†’ should ask for amount but went to clarification
- "spent 1400 on sweets" â†’ should log as food category but went to clarification
- "chocolate" â†’ should ask for amount but went to clarification

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Improved Amount Parsing** (`parse_amount` function)
```python
def parse_amount(amount_str):
    """Parse amount string like '750k' to 750000"""
    if not amount_str:
        return None
    
    amount_str = str(amount_str).lower().strip()
    
    # Handle common patterns
    if 'k' in amount_str:
        # Remove 'k' and multiply by 1000
        clean_amount = amount_str.replace('k', '').replace(',', '')
        try:
            return float(clean_amount) * 1000
        except ValueError:
            return None
    elif 'm' in amount_str:
        # Remove 'm' and multiply by 1000000
        clean_amount = amount_str.replace('m', '').replace(',', '')
        try:
            return float(clean_amount) * 1000000
        except ValueError:
            return None
    else:
        # Handle regular numbers with commas
        clean_amount = amount_str.replace(',', '')
        try:
            return float(clean_amount)
        except ValueError:
            return None
```

**Improvements**:
- Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added support for comma-separated numbers (e.g., "1,000")
- Added support for decimal values (e.g., "1.5k")
- Better handling of edge cases

### 2. **Enhanced Category Mapping** (`map_category` function)
```python
def map_category(item):
    """Map common items to categories"""
    if not item:
        return "misc"
    
    item_lower = str(item).lower()
    category_map = {
        # Food
        "popcorn": "food", "snack": "food", "chips": "food", "candy": "food",
        "chocolate": "food", "ice cream": "food", "cake": "food", "bread": "food",
        "milk": "food", "eggs": "food", "meat": "food", "fish": "food",
        "vegetables": "food", "fruits": "food", "rice": "food", "pasta": "food",
        
        # Sports
        "baseball": "sports", "baseball bat": "sports", "football": "sports",
        "basketball": "sports", "tennis": "sports", "gym": "sports",
        "fitness": "sports", "workout": "sports", "exercise": "sports",
        "cricket": "sports", "cricket kit": "sports", "cricket bat": "sports",
        "cricket ball": "sports", "cricket equipment": "sports", "sports kit": "sports",
        "badminton": "sports", "badminton racket": "sports", "badminton kit": "sports",
        "swimming": "sports", "swimming gear": "sports", "yoga": "sports",
        "yoga mat": "sports", "weights": "sports", "dumbbells": "sports",
        
        # Electronics
        "phone": "electronics", "laptop": "electronics", "computer": "electronics",
        "charger": "electronics", "headphones": "electronics", "watch": "electronics",
        "tablet": "electronics", "camera": "electronics", "speaker": "electronics",
        "keyboard": "electronics", "mouse": "electronics", "gaming mouse": "electronics",
        "monitor": "electronics", "printer": "electronics", "scanner": "electronics",
        "webcam": "electronics", "microphone": "electronics", "router": "electronics",
        
        # Clothing
        "hat": "clothing", "cap": "clothing", "scarf": "clothing", "gloves": "clothing",
        "socks": "clothing", "underwear": "clothing", "belt": "clothing",
        
        # ... (many more categories and items)
    }
    return category_map.get(item_lower, "misc")
```

**Improvements**:
- Added "popcorn" to food category
- Added "baseball bat" to sports category
- Added "hat" to clothing category
- Added "cricket kit" to sports category
- Added "gaming mouse" to electronics category
- Added "sweets" to food category
- Added many more items across all categories
- Better coverage for common expense items

### 3. **Improved LLM Router Prompt with Better Expense Recognition**
```python
EXPENSE RECOGNITION PATTERNS:
- "spent X on Y" â†’ amount=X, item=Y
- "bought Y" â†’ item=Y (ask for amount)
- "X for Y" â†’ amount=X, item=Y
- "Y for X" â†’ amount=X, item=Y
- "X PKR on Y" â†’ amount=X, item=Y
- "Y cost X" â†’ amount=X, item=Y

EXAMPLES:
User: "spent 1400 on sweets"
{
  "reasoning": "Complete expense: sweets for 1400 PKR",
  "tool_name": "log_expense_tool",
  "intent": "log_expense",
  "extracted_data": {
    "amount": 1400,
    "item": "sweets",
    "category": "food"
  }
}

User: "bought sweets"
{
  "reasoning": "Incomplete expense: item provided but amount missing",
  "tool_name": "log_expense_tool",
  "intent": "log_expense",
  "extracted_data": {
    "item": "sweets",
    "category": "food"
  }
}
```

**Improvements**:
- Clear patterns for recognizing natural language expense statements
- Better examples showing how to extract data from various formats
- More explicit reasoning about handling different expense formats
- Better handling of incomplete vs complete expenses

### 4. **Enhanced Log Expense Tool**
```python
def log_expense_tool(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Handle context from pending expense
    if pending_expense and not amount:
        amount = pending_expense.get("amount")
        state["amount"] = amount
        logger.info(f"ðŸ”§ Using pending amount: {amount}")
    
    if pending_expense and not item:
        item = pending_expense.get("item")
        state["item"] = item
        logger.info(f"ðŸ”§ Using pending item: {item}")
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
    
    # Generate appropriate response based on context
    if pending_expense:
        response = f"Perfect! I've logged {amount:,.0f} PKR for {item} under {category}. Your expense has been saved successfully!"
    else:
        response = f"Great! I've logged {amount:,.0f} PKR for {item} under {category}. Your expense has been saved successfully!"
```

**Improvements**:
- Better handling of pending expense context
- More consistent response messages
- Clearer logging for debugging
- Context-aware responses

### 5. **Improved Final Response Node with Context Clearing**
```python
def final_response_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # For successful expense logging, use the tool result and clear context
    if intent == "log_expense" and tool_result and tool_result.get("status") == "success":
        response = tool_result.get("response", "Expense logged successfully!")
        # Clear any pending expense context after successful logging
        memory.set_pending_expense(phone_number, None)
        state["final_response"] = response
        return state
    
    # For incomplete expenses, use the tool result directly
    if intent == "log_expense" and tool_result and tool_result.get("status") == "incomplete":
        state["final_response"] = tool_result.get("response", "I need more information to log your expense.")
        return state
    
    # For acknowledgments (thanks, okay, etc.), give a simple acknowledgment
    if intent == "acknowledgment":
        state["final_response"] = "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?"
        return state
```

**Improvements**:
- **Context Clearing**: After successful expense logging, clears pending expense context
- **Acknowledgment Handling**: Properly handles "thanks", "okay", etc.
- Direct use of tool results for expense logging to ensure consistency
- Avoids LLM-generated variations in responses
- More predictable and reliable responses

### 6. **Enhanced Greeting Tool**
```python
def greeting_tool(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Tool: Handle greetings and acknowledgments"""
    user_message = state.get("user_message", "").lower()
    intent = state.get("intent")
    
    # Handle acknowledgments and short responses
    if intent == "acknowledgment" or any(word in user_message for word in ["thanks", "thank you", "okay", "ok", "good", "great", "also", "no", "not"]):
        response = "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?"
    # Handle greetings
    elif any(word in user_message for word in ["hi", "hello", "good morning", "good afternoon", "good evening"]):
        response = "Hello! How can I help with your expenses today?"
    else:
        response = "Hello! How can I help with your expenses today?"
    
    state["tool_result"] = {
        "status": "success",
        "response": response,
        "greeting": True
    }
    return state
```

**Improvements**:
- Better handling of acknowledgments and short responses
- Context-aware greeting responses
- Proper intent classification
- Handles frustration expressions like "no not again"

### 7. **Enhanced Clarification Tool**
```python
def clarification_tool(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Tool: Ask for clarification"""
    user_message = state.get("user_message", "").lower()
    
    # Handle very short responses
    if len(user_message.strip()) <= 2:
        response = "I didn't quite catch that. Could you please be more specific? For example:\nâ€¢ '500 for groceries' to log an expense\nâ€¢ 'How much did I spend this week?' to check expenses\nâ€¢ 'Show me my spending breakdown' for analysis"
    else:
        response = "I'm not sure what you meant. You can:\nâ€¢ Log expenses: '500 for groceries'\nâ€¢ Ask queries: 'How much did I spend this week?'\nâ€¢ Get breakdowns: 'Show me my spending breakdown'"
    
    state["tool_result"] = {
        "status": "clarification_needed",
        "response": response
    }
    return state
```

**Improvements**:
- Better handling of very short responses (like "g", "o")
- More helpful clarification messages
- Context-aware suggestions
